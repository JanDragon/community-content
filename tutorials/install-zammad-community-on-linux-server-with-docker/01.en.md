## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to setup Zammad Community with Docker Compose on a Linux based operating system. With Zammad you can easily manage support tickets and requests.


**Prerequisites**

* A Server with a Linux based operating system and minumum 4 GB of RAM. Also you need a system which supports Docker Compose.

## Step 1 - Install Docker and Docker

Connect to your server via SSH, and install Docker. You also need to install Curl and Git. You can do that by running:

`apt update && apt install -y curl git`

`curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | CHANNEL=stable sh`

## Step 2 - Enable and start the Docker Service

You can do that with the following command:

`systemctl enable docker.service`

`systemctl start docker.service`

## Step 3 - Install Docker Compose

Now you can setup a Docker Compose. 

`curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/$(curl -Ls https://www.servercow.de/docker-compose/latest.php)/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`

Now we can set the right file permissions with the following command:

`chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`

## Step 4 - Download Zammad Community

We need to acces the opt directory with the following command:

`cd /opt`

After that we can download Zammand from the offical GitHub reponsitory.

`git clone https://github.com/zammad/zammad-docker-compose.git`

Then we have to go inside the downloaded folder and set the vm.max_map_count:

`cd zammad-docker-compose`

`sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`

## Step 5 - Start Zammad

Now we just need to start Docker:

`docker-compose up`


## Conclusion

Now you can access the web panel by your server IP address or your domain. There you have to create an admin account and then you can start helping people.
